*some classes taken at Sato Academy of Math & Science transferred over to Long Beach City College
## Projects
A list of projects I am currently working on or have already completed that are the most important to me.

Programming based projects:
- `bendtech-automation`: An automated system for creating new projects in the tube bending CAD software Bend-Tech written in Python. https://github.com/ConnorDeLeo/bendtech-automation
- `modifiedIVT`: A **very** incomplete test application that I am working on to prove that the Intermediate Value Theorem can work differently, applying to a wider variety of functions. The basic theory is that when proving the IVT, you use "According to the IVT, there must be a value `c` where `f(c) = l` on the range `j < c < k` because `f(j) = x < f(c) = l < f(k) = y`." However, there are certain applications where you may wish to use the IVT on a continuous piecewise function with a constant portion at the start or end, requiring the use of `<=` or `>=` as opposed to the basic `<` and `>` to define the constant as a portion of the function required by IVT. For example, on the graph of any function `f(x)`, suppose `f(5) = 10`, the IVT does not gaurantee that there will be a value on the given set `5 < c < 6` where `f(c) = 10`, even though there is always a value where it does, `c = 5` because `f(5) = 10`. https://github.com/ConnorDeLeo/School/tree/main/AP%20Calculus/modifiedIVT
- `StringTools`: A `C++` library for text formats drawing upon a large amount of publicly available functions, all packaged into one neat source.
- `RobotCSnippets`: The repository I am most happy about never having to add to again. `RobotC` is a tangential fork of `C` used for the Vex V4 Robotics systems. The language works pretty similarly to `C` but also not at all.

Engineering based projects:
- NAR Jr. Level 1 HPR Certification Rocket: A rocket designed using the CAD softwares `OpenRocket` and `Fusion360` and principles of rocket design learned in REDD. The rocket was then constructed using a fiberglass body tube, a 3D printed nosecone, and laser cut fins (alongside centering rings used to stabilize the motor tube). The rocket was successfully launched on `10/14/2023` at the ROC launch site in Lucerne Valley, California where it landed in flyable condition after a nearly perfect flight. https://www.youtube.com/shorts/-pHkBOT6X6M
- Project Drifttt: A system for automatically scoring drifting competitions, name subject to change.
- Electric Racing GoKart: Using an existing frame, my team welded an extension piece (so I can fit as I am 6'10" / 2.0828m tall), built a new hydraulic braking system, mounted a new 10,000 Watt engine with 4 LiIon batteries from a Nissan Leaf. Kart is in a drivable state, with a lot of bugs to fix. It will not be racing in UCI's electric kart race due to a probable failure for safety inspection.*
- SFI 25.1k Spec Racing Chassis: A racing chassis for a 1989 Mazda NA Miata, powered by a large Chevy LS. The frame was designed using the CAD softwares `Fusion360`, `Inventor`, and `Bend-Tech`. Uses a range of 4130 Chromoly Steel tubing, with the primary size being 1.625 inches in diameter with a 0.083 inch wall thickness.
